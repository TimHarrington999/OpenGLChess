# OpenGLChess

## Introduction
My goal with this project is to create a functional Chess game and learn enough OpenGL to display it. I got tired of creating programs that ran on the command line and wanted to program something with a GUI. To learn OpenGL, I am following along with the book "Learn OpenGL,"
which can be found here: https://learnopengl.com/
